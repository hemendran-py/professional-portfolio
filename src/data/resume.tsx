  summary: `At the end of my third year in computer science, I shifted my focus from just academics to **building real-world projects and scalable products**. I have interned in **cloud infrastructure**, **security analysis**, and **full-stack development** while consistently learning through hands-on work. Along the way, I&apos;ve built multiple projects. I&apos;m now focused on using my skills to **solve meaningful problems**, contribute to open source, and explore opportunities in **cloud and DevOps**.
